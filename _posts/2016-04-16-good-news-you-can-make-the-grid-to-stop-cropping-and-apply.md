Good news, you can make The Grid to stop cropping, and applying crappy filters to your photos. 

Bad news, you need to get a PhD to find out how to do that. Good luck!

Ok ok, I will tell. You need to click on the image and choose Details, yes Details, not Settings or Options, Details. The problem is that this is not something people do to get to settings. For most web users the sole reason to click on the image is to make it larger. That is the [affordance][0] of the image. To indicate that the are more way to interact with an image another [signifier][1] that communicates the affordance.
