Hi,   

My name is Jurijs Kovzels. I code and do UX. This website is an attempt to use The Grid for good, but so far The Grid appears to my as massive AI powered clusterfuck. But since I pre-paid for a year to have a pleasure to use this service I will revisit it from time to time.  

By the way, I tweet @ykovzel.
