One might think that it is reasonable to expect that new post could be created from content. Right? Wrong! 

From Content screen one can only observe existing posts and edits them.

To create new post you should open drop down menu on the top of the page and be desperate enough to try to **Drafts** option even if you know that you don't have any drafts. 

This interaction is designed as if creation of new post is a feature of The Grid which people user super rarely so that it could be places under the obscurely label menu option outside the scope of the site.

Dear, The Grid I get that Drafts exist separately from the site and linked to the site only when it is time to publish, but I doubt that I was something to do with mental models of majority of users. Most people will have just one site and when they are in context of the site they expect an easy way to add new post.
